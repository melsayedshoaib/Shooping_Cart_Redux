# Shopping Cart With Redux toolkit

## Features

- Routing with createBroweserRoter, RouterProvider, and Outlet.
- Store file as the main store in our project where all slices live in. it has 3 slices, products slice, single product slice, and cart slice.
- In products slice, data is fetched using the async thunk, at the fulfilled, data is stored in the products array via action.payload. Error is handled by RejectedWithValue.
- In single product slice, whenver click on any product, it will be displayed in the about component, extracted its id with useParams hook.
- Cart slice handles all the methods being used in the cart component, from adding to cart, removing an item, increasing, decreasing, and clearing the whole cart.

## Enhancements

I've encountered a problem when dispatcing the thunk functions calling in useEffect as you can notice in the products component, I've used useCallback hook to make sure that the function won't be re-created every time component did mount, so we are free of infinite looping, but whenever out dependencies change, here comes the part when re-creation takes place.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
